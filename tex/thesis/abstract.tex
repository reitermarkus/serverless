In the grand scheme of things, cloud computing is still a relative new development which
has seen rapid growth in recent years and with that has seen a lot of technologies emerge around it.
One of those is the concept of serverless computing or \textit{Function as a Service
(FaaS)}. Due to its versatile nature, a lot of big players in the cloud computing field jumped on it
and have their own implementation in their portfolio.

Likewise, the \textit{Internet of Things (IoT)} has also seen large adoption in many aspects of life
and is an integral part of it. Be it for household appliances or in industrial applications,
\textit{IoT} devices can be found everywhere.

This bachelor thesis tries to show the usefulness of serverless computing in conjunction
with \textit{IoT} devices by building an infrastructure to host serverless functions where
all \textit{IoT} devices can then send their data to. While not a classic \textit{IoT} device, there
is also support for both \textit{Android} and \textit{iOS} devices to transmit data. This data can
then further be used for analytics and visualised with graphs in a web interface.
