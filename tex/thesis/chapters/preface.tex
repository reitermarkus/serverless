\section*{Preface}

This thesis was done by two students. The tasks of implementation, as well as those of writing the
thesis were distributed evenly between both members of the team.

The following shows the contributions of each member regarding the implementation in more detail:

\begin{itemize}

  \item \textit{Rasperry Pi} application and wiring: \texttt{mostly Markus}
  \item \textit{Serverless Functions}: \texttt{mostly Markus}
  \item Developing the \textit{OpenFaaS} stack and its core components: \texttt{Markus and Michael}
  \item Mobile application: \texttt{mostly Michael}
  \item \textit{Serverless UI}:\texttt{mostly Michael}
\end{itemize}

The following shows the contributions of each member regarding the written part in more detail:

\begin{itemize}

  \item Section 1 \textit{Introduction}: \texttt{Markus and Michael}
  \item Section 2 \textit{Background}: \texttt{Markus and Michael}
  \item Section 3 \textit{Motivation}: \texttt{Markus and Michael}
  \item Section 4 \textit{Results}: \texttt{Markus and Michael}
  \item Section 5 \textit{Conclusion and Future Work}: \texttt{Markus and Michael}

In all the parts where one member has done the most work, the other member of the team has
thoroughly verified the work and agreed on those implementing or writing details.
