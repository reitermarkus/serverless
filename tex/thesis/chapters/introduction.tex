\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In recent years, the number of IoT (Internet of Things) devices has been growing continuously.
Naturally, all of these devices generate a lot of data. This usually happens asynchronously, which
means that a normal server processing this data would either be under or overutilised. A well known
method to deal with this kind of problem is to use the \textit{edge-fog-cloud} approach to process
data earlier, either on an edge device itself or on a fog device instead of doing all processing in
the cloud, which can have noticeable performance benefits. This is where \textit{serverless
computing} comes into play. In contrast to traditional software development where the software is
centred around a single server delivering all of the functionality. \textit{Serverless computing} is
based around the idea of splitting this functionality into separate functions, which is especially
beneficial when dealing with many IoT devices, since functions can be scaled individually according
to the current utilisation and can be started on demand. This results in more efficient usage of
resources and improved modularity.

Today IoT devices can be found in household appliances like washing machines, fridges, televisions,
garage doors and many more. For this thesis, their application for the purpose of data collection
was our primary focus. A big advantage to using IoT devices is the low cost of some of the
do-it-yourself and \textit{open source} solutions, which can be achieved with a
\textit{micro-controller} such as the \textit{Raspberry Pi} and readily available
\whitelist{off-the-shelf} sensors.

In this thesis, we explore the possibility of combining both \textit{serverless computing} and IoT
for the purpose of analysing sensor data. More specifically, we want to test the limits of cheap IoT
hardware in a \textit{serverless} context. Furthermore, we want to subsequently visualise the
collected data in an intuitive user interface that can be displayed on any device.

The end result of this thesis is a system which can be used to collect sensor data from IoT devices
using a \textit{serverless} architecture and an accompanying web interface to visualise the
collected data. In the following sections we explain the technologies used, a more detailed
explanation about the motivation for using \textit{serverless computing} as well as how the
different parts of our project were implemented. Finally, we provide some results on how our system
performs when running on affordable hardware.
