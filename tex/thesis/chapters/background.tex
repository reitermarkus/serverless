\section{Background}

In this part we try to make the reader more familiar with the individual technologies and their
respective terms, that will be used throughout the thesis. Firstly we start by discussing the main
topic: serverless computing, we then will go on in more detail about \textit{Docker} and our
specific use case.

in popularity in recent years largely due to shift of enterprise applications deplyoment in
