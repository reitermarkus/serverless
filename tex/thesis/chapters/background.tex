\section{Background}

In this part we try to make the reader more familiar with the individual technologies and their
respective terms, that will be used throughout the thesis. Firstly we start by discussing the main
topic: Serverless Computing, we then will go on in more detail about \textit{Docker} and our
specific use case.

\subsection{Serverless Computing}

Serverless Computing is a new emerging paradigm for deploying applications into the cloud. It gained
in popularity in recent years largely due to shift of enterprise applications deployment in
containers and micro-services. Serverless Computing offers developers a simplified programming model
for creating cloud applications while minimizing operational concerns. \cite{servprog}
