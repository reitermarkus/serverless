\section{Serverless Stack}

Arguably, the main part of our thesis is the serverless stack hence it's also in the title of the
project. When doing research for our project, thinking about the serverless stack was one of the
first things we did. We came across many different serverless frameworks. \textit{OpenWhisk},
\textit{Fission} and \textit{Kubeless} just to name a few. While all of those seem to have their
benefits, none of them seemed to be as versatile as \textit{OpenFaaS}.

\textit{OpenFaaS} poses itself to have first class support for \textit{Docker Swarm} and being
\textit{Kubernetes} native. The former was particularly interesting for us as this meant that we
could test the framework without having to install any external tool except for  \textit{Docker}.

Running was as simple as cloning the \textit{OpenFaaS} repository, calling \texttt{docker swarm
init} and executing the provided initialisation script. Deploying an actual function is equally
simple. One has the option to either deploy a function from the store through the nicely designed
\textit{OpenFaaS} gateway on port~8080 or with the preferred way, which is using the
\texttt{faas-cli} command line tool.

Deploying a function from the store with it would look as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
faas store deploy figlet
\end{lstlisting}

Here, \texttt{figlet} is the name of the function in the store.

After gaining a grasp of how the platform works, we decided to put our own spin on it by firstly
modifying the given deploy script to our needs and porting it from \textit{Bash} to \textit{Rust}
for it to be cross platform. The next step then was to write our own configuration file for swarm
deployment, namely \texttt{deploy.yml}. This \textit{YAML} file includes the configuration for
\textit{Kafka}, \textit{Zookeeper}, \textit{MongoDB}, various services that are needed for
\textit{OpenFaaS}, a bunch of gateways for visualisation and the \textit{Kafka-Connector}. All of
these service are \textit{Docker} images and can therefore be easily updated and extended.
\textit{Kafka-Connector} is particularly interesting, because its main purpose is to call a
serverless function on a Kafka topic change. To make a function react to a Kafka topic we can again
use our example store function \texttt{figlet}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
faas store deploy figlet --annotation topic="faas-request"
\end{lstlisting}

The deployment aspect is the same as before, therefore the interesting part is the \\
\texttt{-{}-annotation} flag, where \texttt{topic="faas-request"} is the \textit{Kafka} topic the
function is supposed to listen to and act on. We subsequently can look for the result in the logs of
the connector service. \\
While the feature of deploying functions from the store is really nice, it is not suitable for our
use case, as we highly depend on custom functions written by ourselves.
