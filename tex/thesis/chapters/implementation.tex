\section{Implementation}

Our task is to do \textit{IoT data analytics with serverless computing}, therefore as a first step
we started out by thinking about the underlying infrastructure. We decided on using Apache Kafka for
streaming, \textit{MongoDB} as our database, \textit{OpenFaaS} as the \textit{serverless platform} and
\textit{Rust} as the programming language for our \textit{serverless functions}. The whole stack can then be
initialized via \textit{Ruby Rake} file, which acts as our main deployment script.
