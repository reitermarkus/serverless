\chapter*{Preface}

This thesis was conducted by two students. The tasks of the implementation as well as those of
writing the thesis were distributed evenly between both members of the team.

The following shows the contributions of each member regarding the implementation in more detail:

\begin{itemize}
  \setlength\itemsep{-1em}
  \item \textit{Rasperry Pi} application and wiring: \textbf{mostly Markus}
  \item \textit{Serverless Functions}: \textbf{mostly Markus}
  \item Developing the \textit{OpenFaaS} stack and its core components: \textbf{Markus and Michael}
  \item Mobile application: \textbf{mostly Michael}
  \item \textit{Serverless UI}: \textbf{mostly Michael}
\end{itemize}

The following shows the contributions of each member regarding the written part in more detail:

\begin{itemize}

  \item \Cref{sec:architecture} \nameref{sec:architecture}: \textbf{Markus and Michael}
  \item \Cref{sec:background} \nameref{sec:background}: \textbf{Markus and Michael}
  \item \Cref{sec:motivation} \nameref{sec:motivation} \textit{Motivation}: \textbf{Markus and Michael}

  \item \Cref{sec:results} \nameref{sec:results}: \textbf{Markus and Michael}
  \item \Cref{sec:conclusion} \nameref{sec:conclusion}: \textbf{Markus and Michael}
\end{itemize}

In all the parts where one member has done most of the work, the other member of the team has
thoroughly verified the work and agreed on the implementation or writing details.
